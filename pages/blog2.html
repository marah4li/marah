                  <p class="post-excerpt"> today when i came in and saw my teamates it was a bit awakward i think we didnt do much of the ice break games were we couldve gotten to knoe each other a bit more . but we first had a tal about agile methology and i learnt that Agile is an iterative way of managing projects and developing software that makes it easier for teams to deliver value to their customers more quickly and effectively. and i loved that fact where we had to create the potato head using the legos that really helped us understand the method and help us know our teammates better as we were working togther . we also did a microbit with Dominik i loved it so much it was really intresting and i loved doing the blocks and using python to.
